              Hello üëãüèº, I&quot;m Travis Amaral. I live in sunny California and
              work for Shopify.
            </h1>
            <div className="mt-6 space-y-7 text-base text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
              <p>
                I love user interfaces. Studying them, making them, talking
                about them. There is something so interesting about building a
                web interface and approaching it from an almost phycology angle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before I got started as a front-end developer I wanted to be a
                designer. Well I didn&rsquo;t know that was an actual career. I
                just thought how cool would it be if someone wanted a logo or
                branding made and you did it? Only problem was I have almost 0
                ability to draw or make designs from scratch üòÇ. However, I{' '}
                <em>could</em> learn to turn designs into &quot;real&quot;
                things on the internet. So thats what I decided to focus on.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had no real idea how to get into the industry so I would just
                make sites for free or very cheap. I&rsquo;d make sites for my
                friends, or their friends, local businesses, etc. Eventually a
                friend saw what I was doing and had an opening at her
                fiance&rsquo;s small e-commerce agency.
              </p>
              <p>
                I&rsquo;ve been lucky to have worked on a variety of different
                projects. I build Shopify sites for high end fashion brands,
                brochure sites for consumer goods brands, made sweepstakes sites
                for food companies and even made a UI for an barcode scanner
                like you see on the walls of Target.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now I work at Shopify, where our mission is to &quot;make
                commerce better for everyone&quot;. I&rsquo;ve always loved the
                Shopify brand and product and I love working for the company.
                I&rsquo;m grateful I&rsquo;ve had so many opportunities to build
                sites for all of these years.
